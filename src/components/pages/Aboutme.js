      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am an aspiring web developer based in North County San Diego. A few of
        my favorite things are rock climbing, creating art, and spending time
        with friends and family. I went to school up in San Jose State
        University and graduated with degree in Spanish. I spent some time after
        graduation working at a restaurant. It has taken me a while but I have
        decided to take a deep dive into a totally different career path. I hope
        to learn lots and be able to apply the concepts learned during class in
        the real world.
